Main Script: 
write a program that parses a sentence and replaces each word with the following: 
 - first letter
 - number of distinct characters between first and last character
 - last letter. For example, Smooth would become S3h. 

Words are separated by spaces or non-alphabetic characters and these separators should be maintained in their original form and location in the answer.
